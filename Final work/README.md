### Introduction
This project is mainly about displaying a a 3D painting .It also has a dynamic display.The models and maps in the pictures are all designed by me.The raycaster is used to make a mouse click to play the animation. In addition, there are snowflakes like falling blocks and cactus made of cube in the picture.i also add music into the index.

### Design details and purpose
The girl in the picture is looking at the mirror, which shows the reflection of the girl and some marine creatures. When the mouse clicks on the mirror, these creatures will float in the wind. This is to show that many people have a soft and colorful heart beneath their hard exterior. When we touch it, it will also give us a response. So I set the scene in the desert, and the scenery outside the mirror is black and white, in order to show that our external performance may only be a kind of empty body to protect ourselves, while the inner part of us is colorful and energetic. The main purpose of this project is to appeal to people to find out more about themselves and don't be afraid to face the depth of their heart.

### Insipration

It was inspired by the Darjeeling Limited which is my favourite movie,after i analyzed it,i found that I was most interested in the personality conflicts of the characters, so I drew a sketch.
Then I thought it would be more interesting and special to make it into a 3d model.Therefore, i s tarted to finish this work.
